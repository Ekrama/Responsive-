              <p>My name is Ekrama Omar, I was born in Kenya, I know 4 languages which are Somali, Arabic, English, and Swahili. I have always been mature for age because i have been around adults most of my life. I'm lucky enough to be awarded employee of the month 5 times in the past 2 years at my current job. I always like to be the best at what i do, I am interested in learning and working with full stack development, like the front-end and back-end
